**Brief History of version control software**

VCS' are like a time machine for digital files, allowing people to track previous versions and collaborate on the same document without messing things up.
Early VCS go back to the 1970's, they then Centralized to early VCS in the 90's-2000s; allowing developers to to work together by hosting on a single central server.

Distributed VCS such as Git were developed in 2005 - allowing developers to have a full copy of project history, making collaboration and backups more robust.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, in 2005.

Git quickly became the standard for version control because:
* It allows **fast and efficient collaboration** across teams.
* It's **distributed**, meaning every contributor has the full project history.
* It makes it easy to **merge changes** and work on multiple versions of a project at once.


**History of GitHub the company**

GitHub started in 2008 as a hosting service for Git repositories. It made Git easy for people to use and introduced features like:

* Pull requests (where people suggest changes to a project).
* Issues and discussions (where teams communicate about work).
* GitHub Actions (which automates tasks like testing code).

In 2018, Microsoft bought GitHub for $7.5 billion, which raised some concerns about whether it would remain open and independent. 

So far, Microsoft has largely allowed GitHub to operate freely while adding features like GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster.

**History of Free and Open software. [FOSS]**

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) became much more prevelent with the introduction of the internet.

Prior to the internet, software was primarily developed and solf as proprietary software.

FOSS has led to the creation of many of the internet's biggest tolls (Linux, Apache, Firefox, Android...)




**How they can use the tools in their everyday life even if they are not a programmer**

* To share and collaborate on projects with others.
* To store their work safely (GitHub acts as a backup).
* To showcase their skills (many developers use it as a portfolio).
* To contribute to open-source projects and help improve software that millions of people use.



**Key Terminology**


* version control software: A tool for tracking file changes. Examples: Git, SVN, Mercurial.
* git: A specific VCS created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is open-source and used worldwide.
* github: A website that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools.
* github.com: The actual web platform where people store, share, and manage Git projects.
* alternative to github: GitLab is a great alternative with similar features but more self-hosting options (meaning companies can run their own private GitHub-like service).

**GitHub | version control software or social media?**

i. Have a README.md file - This file is the welcome page to your repository and serves to orient new arrivals. Find three sources about how to use the README effectively on a GitHub repository. Find three sources about how to use the markdown format effectively. Take what you like and craft your README. You can always edit it later so focus more on form than content.

ii. Have a LICENSE - Read about common licenses used on GitHub. Read the UVA School of Data Science reccomendation on Open Science. Explore why licensing your work is important and explain that significant to another member of the cohort.
