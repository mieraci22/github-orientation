**Brief History of version control software**

VCS' are like a time machine for digital files, allowing people to track previous versions and collaborate on the same document without messing things up.
Early VCS go back to the 1970's, they then Centralized to early VCS in the 90's-2000s; allowing developers to to work together by hosting on a single central server.

Distributed VCS such as Git were developed in 2005 - allowing developers to have a full copy of project history, making collaboration and backups more robust.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, in 2005.

Git quickly became the standard for version control because:
* It allows **fast and efficient collaboration** across teams.
* It's **distributed**, meaning every contributor has the full project history.
* It makes it easy to **merge changes** and work on multiple versions of a project at once.


**History of GitHub the company**

GitHub started in 2008 as a hosting service for Git repositories. It made Git easy for people to use and introduced features like:

* Pull requests (where people suggest changes to a project).
* Issues and discussions (where teams communicate about work).
* GitHub Actions (which automates tasks like testing code).

In 2018, Microsoft bought GitHub for $7.5 billion, which raised some concerns about whether it would remain open and independent. 

So far, Microsoft has largely allowed GitHub to operate freely while adding features like GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster.

**History of Free and Open software. [FOSS]**

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) became much more prevelent with the introduction of the internet.

Prior to the internet, software was primarily developed and solf as proprietary software.

FOSS has led to the creation of many of the internet's biggest tolls (Linux, Apache, Firefox, Android...)




**How they can use the tools in their everyday life even if they are not a programmer**

* To share and collaborate on projects with others.
* To store their work safely (GitHub acts as a backup).
* To showcase their skills (many developers use it as a portfolio).
* To contribute to open-source projects and help improve software that millions of people use.



**Key Terminology**


* version control software: A tool for tracking file changes. Examples: Git, SVN, Mercurial.
* git: A specific VCS created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is open-source and used worldwide.
* github: A website that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools.
* github.com: The actual web platform where people store, share, and manage Git projects.
* alternative to github: GitLab is a great alternative with similar features but more self-hosting options (meaning companies can run their own private GitHub-like service).

**GitHub | version control software or social media?**

Github serves as both a VCS and Social Network for developers, seamlessly integrating functionalities from both domains.

At it's core, HitHub is built upon Git, a distributed VCS that enables developers to track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently,
and manage project histories.

Beyond version control, GitHub incorporates social networking features that foster a vibrant developer community:
* Profiles and Followers
* Community Building
* Code Discovery and Exploration

## Common Licenses used on GitHub

> https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository

Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.

Licenses define how others can use, modify, and distribute your code.
Without a license your code is not legally open-source, and people might be hesitant to use or contribute to your project.

* MIT License (Permissive): Anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code, as long as they credit the original author.
* Apache License 2.0: Similar to MIT but includes an explicit patent grant.
* GNU General Public License (GPL): Requires that any modified version of the code is also open-source under the same license.
* Creative Commons (CC) Licenses: Often used for non-software content, such as documentation.
